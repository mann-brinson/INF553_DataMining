While the rooms themselves are fairly comfortable, they're nowhere near as luxe as, say, the Venetian/Palazzo or the Wynn/Encore. It's simply going to be a decent, comfortable experience.\n\nAs with many Vegas hotels, they charge an extortionary \"resort fee,\" which ostensibly pays for things like wi-fi and fitness center usage that are standard at most non-Vegas hotels. Even then, you don't necessarily need the wi-fi if you have a cell phone plan with unlimited data and tethering, and you also don't necessarily need the fitness center since you'll be getting 2-3x your normal daily steps with all the endless walking that's required inside casinos and on the Strip. That having been said, the fitness center is quite nice and well-stocked.\n\nIf you're a guest, getting around the common areas of the hotel is also going to be a challenge as they're so crowded with tourists, and as the entrance to the guest rooms is buried at the rear of the casino (read: a somewhat long, crowded walk to any exit leading onto the Strip). If rates are decent here and include some sort of bonus (like a meal credit at MGM properties), then I'd stay here again. If rates are super out of line, however, than I wouldn't even bother.", "date": "2018-08-26 07:33:20"}

Also, during my 2nd visit the 2 bulbs were out in the bed.  Lastly, I would out if I would have started my package 2 days later I would have got my following month for $1.00. That was highly disappointing. \n\nMy 3rd visit I come in pick up my lotion no problem; however I decided to ask her what the full price of the lotion was...she provided me the price after tax...which was exactly what I paid. The girls behind the desk advised I would need to go through corporate for the difference. \n\nSo far - this company is a mess. I can not believe they do not provide their front line with the proper tools to provide good customer service. \n\nShould you really trust a company that can not trust their staff to adjust a price by 30%?

The Dr. he saw treated him for a sinus infection and prescribed an antibiotic.  After 3 days on the antibiotic and not feeling any better, coughing as much or more AND diarrhea, my husband called the office and requested a different antibiotic.  He spoke to a nurse who relayed a message from the Dr. of \"take Pepto Bismol\".  What the heck?!  There are many antibiotics out there, why would you hesitate prescribing another that may not have these side effects and may have the patient feeling better, but instead say, let's bandaid the diarrhea with another OTC medicine??  What a lazy, answer - I was furious!\n\nToday my husband is back in the same facility (a week later), feeling & sounding worse than he did a week ago.  His mucus is no longer clear.  He has not slept much in at least two nights because of the cough.  There is one other person in the waiting room with him, same symptoms, same story (been there a week ago and is no better, actually worse). This time he got 3 prescriptions, a different anitbiotic, a steroid and cough medicine (which you would've thought should've been prescribed initially).  \n\nThis Dr. is a waste of time and should be removed for his lack of care and laziness.  He has an arrogant, uncaring demeanor and no bedside manner AT ALL.  For lack of a better word, he's an ass.  People don't go to the Dr. because they are bored and want to hang out, they are miserable and need your help.  They don't want to come back in a week, they don't want to run to the toilet because of something you prescribed or take OTC medicines that don't work.

So the menu is slightly all over the place, but in a good way *wink. You get the normal suspects, dishes with eggs/bacon/etc. - but it's the basic dishes with a twist is what this place is known for. \n\nMy hubby ordered the savory French toast?...let that sink in right quick. So essentially picture a normal French toast dish but think opposite. On top of his pieces of bread laid melted cheese, bacon and fried eggs with sprinkles of fresh Parmesan cheese. The most memorable thing about this dish is the white sauce the French toast is drenched in! I'm still trying to guess what it's made out of, but whatever it is, it's f/ckn delicious! \n\nI opted to try the Chicken and Mac n' Cheese Waffles. Yup, you read that right! The boneless-fried Chicken is AMAZING. The breaded outside and juice inside?! Very flavorful! The waffles too, were very different and tasty to dip into their house made syrup! Seriously theeeee best chicken and waffles I've ever had- possibly the best in Henderson! Wootwoot! \n\nI usually like to try a place once, and then continue on to other business so that I can try a new place every time- but The Stove is a place I don't mind returning to visit.

It's juicy, succulent and really lives up to the saying, \"melts in your mouth.\"  I got the regular bacon cheeseburger, which comes with 2 patties.  I added mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions and mushrooms.  I also added the regular Five Guys style fries and a drink.  The burger was HUGE and sooooooo delicious!  The fries were thick hand cut fries.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside...just the way I like it.  BTW, the regular fries feeds two people.  I can eat a lot and had to share LOL.  My ONLY rant is that I don't think paying $15 for my meal at Five Guys or anywhere else for that matter is practical for one sitting, so I wouldn't be indulging here every week, but nice to have once in a while.\n\nIf you're a fan of In N Out, trust me, you'll LOVE Five Guys.

While in the area, we went inside- yay! It's like a spacious Buy/Sell version of Blockbuster and Game Stop mixed together (smaller than Zia Records). They have games, game accessories, blu rays dvds, regular dvds, music cds, and VHS tapes- gotta tell my Mother-in-Law since she just asked us yesterday about what she should do with all those 100s of VHS tapes. They pay $1.00 for each tape with the case in perfect condition. On the cds, it's whatever the computer says is the current market value (kinda like www.secondspin.com- except they also add the media mail rate into the total price that they pay; so strict, the cases have to be A+.). \n\nMy husband was like, \"Why did we go in here?\" He saw several things that he wanted to buy but settled on a game for $6.99. (We had more stops to make.) I thought that the prices on the blu rays was actually pretty good- $7.99 to $19.99 (the newer ones cost more, which makes sense to me). We're always searching for new blu rays to add to our collection. Plus we have a few in mind that we want to \"replace\" (we have them in regular dvd format, but we want to upgrade to blu rays). \n\nI noticed that some VHS tapes were at clearance for 25 cents each. The VHS section is comprised of two small sections. I didn't really look at the regular dvds and cds.  \n\nThere were three people (two indie types & one gamer type) working there. One manning the register, one very busy with more dvd/game sorting (stacks & stacks), and one in back?; maybe on a break as there was only one other customer besides us- it wasn't busy at all.\n\nOddly, there is a sign in front of the (cashier) counter explaining their Buy/Sell process, however, there are a lot of rows of dvds blocking what you are supposed to read. Hmm, they should've gotten another rack or two for those dvds, as they clearly have enough space to accommodate the racks. It would be nice if there was music on- it was really quiet.\n\nLooks like we're coming back next week. And we might sell some stuff like cds (we were gonna do it anyway, through www.secondspin.com- this would save us a trip to the post office) and video games. It's nice to know that we have more options than Zia, Target, Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Game Stop. Hope it's successful.", "date": "2010-08-09 02:42:10"}

It's my 3rd time seeing \"O\", and I'm no less amazed than the first. Before the review, let's get a couple things out of the way.\n\nFirst and foremost, let's please enforce the rule about children in the theater, or at least try and police it a little. I nearly punted a kid into the water because she couldn't be bothered to shut up the entire performance, nor could her parents be bothered to control her. When people pay $100+ per head, they're paying for the show, not audience commentary. That said, not really a controllable from the performers standpoint, so I can't in good conscience lower the rating.\n\n\"O\" does not have a typical storyline, and I get how that throws some people off. After 3 viewings, my takeaway is simple: treat it like one of those illusion pictures. Focus on just one aspect and it won't make much sense, but look at the whole thing from a few steps back and the image forms. It also helps if you've seen the Nutcracker. Beginning is entering a dream, ending is waking up. I really can't say more without spoiling it.\n\nEvery act has its moments, but standouts are always the fire acts. The combination of music and timing to the introduction of the Arsonist is chilling and entrancing. \n\nThe high divers still make me wince when they jump.\n\nThe aerial work is nothing short of magic.\n\nThere is simply so much happening that it's difficult to describe. You can really only try to take it all in. 3 viewings and I'm still ready to go back for more, regardless of price.\n\nI find myself at a loss for words in terms a review, honestly.

Now we are both full and almost grasping for air and hopping we can successfully make it out the door and into our cars before the food coma kicked in, Lol, then the desserts arrived. I pulled through with all my will and take a Spoon fill of The Salted Caramel mouse, and it was Glorious. I decided that no matter what happened that day I would finish that marvelous smooth and silky treat. I am happy to say that I am alive, and hoping to bring my family to dine in the patio with a bottle or three of Wine.

Anytime Sommy came across a tight muscle he'd quietly laugh to himself, growl and shove an elbow back into my shoulder blades. I am not exaggerating. Afterwards everyone of my muscles were limber and relaxed. I can't wait to go back again. \n\nI tipped $15 per their menu and sent my husband there immediately after I was done.

I ordered the fresh rolls to start, though I was disappointed they don't have a vegetarian option anymore. The menu said the fresh rolls have pork and shrimp but only shrimp was present. The rest of the roll was incredibly bland, consisting of lettuce, bean sprouts, and noodles. The peanut sauce it came with had shredded carrot in it, and I think they could have put the carrot in the rolls instead. Cilantro and/or mint wouldn't hurt either. \n\nI usually get the vegetarian pho because I just never know what expect with meat. However, I saw their picture of the beef stew (#20) and it looked delicious. The noodles in the picture were thick and the description said egg noodles so I went with that. When the dish arrived I noticed they were the standard thin rice noodles that usually come with pho. I had to scrape them off the bottom because they were stuck to the bowl and each other. The soup was thicker than pho broth, and had a greasy mouth feel. The flavor was good though. My main issue with the dish was the amount of fat in it. I pulled chunk after chunk of straight fat, not even attached to a piece of meat. I thought for a second that it must be some sort of vegetable because there's no way they expect someone to eat all of that fat? There was still a decent amount of stew meat, but I was turned off and didn't eat much more than the noodles. I would have at least taken the fresh rolls home in a box but they didn't seem worth eating again. I may give this place another try for vegetable pho but I don't recommend the beef stew.

Such was the case with this restaurant. I was staying a few blocks away, and saw this pop up on the Yelp app as a hot new business. I was intrigued, but it was definitely not part of the main tourist section. If that had been my only reason for the trip--touristing--I would have never made it in. But lucky for me, I was there for more Yelpy reasons, and was able to get away from it all and chase down this place.\n\nOn the outside, you can see the story of two Atomics. The venerable old Atomic Liquors has been in that spot for ages. AGES. And the building has been maintained but still has the patina. Next door at the new kitchen, however, you have a new shine, a new patio, and it looks slick. Which is not to say it's not old. Apparently, it's an old mechanic's garage that had been there since earlier in the twentieth century. When it closed, Atomic bought the space with the idea of adding food to the booze side of things, spent a year remodeling, and opened a garage-esque restaurant as an homage. The old steel beams still hold it up, though they had to pour a new foundation.\n\nInside it's polished. It's nice but not fancy by any means. And over time, it will take on more character. I was greeted by Hannah at the door, who was sweet and suggested I take my party of one to the bar. There I was greeted by Chase, who was in the midst of serious ice making. They take their ice seriously, and he does the cooler trick to freeze clear ice, then has a fancy copper contraption to make the ice cubes into perfect spheres. I was mesmerized.\n\nThe menu is bifurcated into two schools of thought. On the one side, you've got bar food. Fried things, apps, shareable things. On the other, you've got nice, plated items. And it really is the kind of space that can pull both off. Back that up with an already proven bar program and you've got the makings of a flexible spot.\n\nI went with the bar side of things. I started with a mini hot dog trio, which was actually a sizeable plate. I liked the Chicago dog best--Detroit dogs aren't my favorite, and the third (Columbian?) was topped with an adorable quail egg. On Chase's suggestion I got the burger and added avocado. They brand the bun with their logo which is a nice tough, and it was served with a big ol' pickle spear. They have a lot of options (21 by my count) to add on to your burger, which is kinda cool--you can certainly make it your own. It was super juicy, and although I don't love horseradish, the sauce was smooth enough to complement the whole thing.\n\nI wish I hadn't been in such a hurry to catch my flight, because I could have stayed for a while. Everyone was super cool, and there was a lot more menu to try. Total chill spot, probably will get rowdier on the weekends, but it's just far enough outside downtown that you're getting some good folks in the door, drawn to good drinks and a food program that looks like it will take hold.", "date": "2017-05-16 05:57:58"}

Hipster & cute at it's finest. The indoor space seemed bigger online than it did in person but nonetheless there was a fair amount of seating inside and outside. It had a nice aesthetic inside, simple, clean, and sleek. Easy on the eyes and inviting! Their menu was simple yet still hard to choose from. I debated between the Hot Mess bowl and the Nom Nom breakfast burrito and the Hot Mess bowl won. The Hot Mess bowl consisted of potatoes, eggs, bell peppers, sour cream, spinach, eggs, tomato, and cholula sauce with a slice of toast. It was flavorful and filling. The potatoes were nicely cooked and seasoned. It was definitely something that I could whip up myself, but for $8 I will gladly pay for convenience sake. I washed my meal down with their Strawberry Jasmine lemonade. Clearly, based on my picture's caption I didn't know what I was drinking LOL but that's beside the point. IT WAS DELISH! It was so refreshing and light. I feel like the Jasmine tea helped calm the tartness of the lemon and the sweetness of the strawberry, making a beautiful menage trois of flavors in your mouth. \n\nConsidering that this wonderful discovery of mine is on the complete opposite side of town from me, I would be more than happy to take the journey back just to have a taste of their other food and drink items. The staff was accommodating and the service was fairly fast. The day I went there was a sign up that food order would take 15 minutes or so to be made but I didn't even notice the time.

As a life-long Chicagoan and fairly recent transplant to Las Vegas, I can't endorse their food enough.  The service is great and everything tastes like it did back in Chicago.  Real Vienna beef and hot dogs, S. Rosen poppyseed buns, pizza puffs, Jay's potato chips, Old Style beer and Green River soda can all be found here!  \n\nI've had the pizza and the thin crust is crisp with just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  The deep dish has a sweet tomato sauce on top and the pepperoni actually has a little bit of spice to it, which is way better than the bland stuff the chains use.  The crust is a butter crust similar to Lou Malnati's or Ricobene's deep dish.\n\nThe hot dogs are made authentic Chicago-style (no ketchup) and include the neon green relish, mustard, celery salt and sport peppers on a Vienna beef dog with a poppyseed bun.  Can't get any better than that.\n\nThe Italian beef is by far my favorite.  On an Italian roll, of course you have to get it dipped so the bread is falling apart and the au jus runs down your arm.  If you like spicy stuff, get their homemade hot giardinera made with habanero peppers.  No need to thank me.\n\nI highly recommend this place, especially if you already \"know\" Chicago food.", "date": "2014-01-29 20:24:50"}

This is absolutely the worst fast food place I have ever eaten at - no questions asked! \n\nWe came in on a Saturday night, after watching a movie at the Galaxy. There was four of us and we were in a good mood and wanted something to eat that was quick and easy. Our mood was instantly ruined by the lovely associate at the counter, Nick. I've met my share of grumpy associates, but I think he takes the cake! We tried cracking jokes and lightening the mood, but Mr. Nick was not having any of it. He rolled his eyes and just gawked at us when ordering. Now it's dead empty on here. No one besides us was in here and he was just so miserable. \n\nFast forward to the food. Half of the order was wrong, with extra ingredients added we requested off and stuff we wanted on, not there. The soda was flat. The fries overly salted. They just did not give a single care in the world. \n\nNow, I had to order an extra item after the fact and just suggested to the employee that he smile a little more that life wasn't that serious. Said employee made it a point to loudly discuss my comment and my party with the manager. Any intelligent person in customer service knows that the worst thing you can do is speak about the client, especially badly, in front of them. \n\nFast forward a bit more, and what seems to be a regular comes in. Out comes the same manager from before being the nicest person I've encountered all night, and then come to find out she personally knows the person who was ordering. Proven then by the fact she walked out to flirt and laugh with said gentleman. To add the icing to the cake, while flirting with the gentleman, she was taking orders through her headset and only proceeded to stop when I made it a point of looking at her and taking a photo. \n\nManagement and staff, please understand that you're in a field where you have to meet hundreds of different people a day. If you do not have the personality or the need for a job, and want to act like its the worst thing in the world, find another profession. There are many an American that would die for a job, and would probably do it better.\n\nUpdate: Upon going up to the counter and asking Nick what his full name was, the manager's name and their store number, I was confronted by the manager and the gentleman she was flirting with. The manager just lowered her head and didn't say anything to me after I told her that they all needed to step their service up. I told them I had taken pictures and had her on video that I would love for the store owner to see of her at work with a customer. At this moment her friend storms up to me and starts to yell at me saying that I need to delete my videos and shut my mouth because his dad was a cop and that it wouldn't end well or me. The manager did absolutely NOTHING to stop this gentleman from threatening me and just stayed quiet. I told her friend to back off that this had nothing to do with him and that if he was an employee. The manager finally stepped in and stated he wasn't, to which I replied that she should probably try to control her friend. The gentleman that was trying to get in my face left after I repeatedly ignored him, while trying to ask for basic information on the establishment. All throughout this, Nick was smirking and laughing. I asked him if something was funny and he smiled. I'm going to be writing the owner of this establishment and filing a formal complaint with the BBB, as I believe the franchise holder should be aware of what the employees are doing, while they're being paid.", "date": "2016-01-03 05:04:44"}

You get a choice between their thin noodles and thick noodles.  Never had the thick ones, but they look OK.  The thin noodles aren't like egg noodles or anything - it's more like udon thickness if I have to describe it.\n \nI've had the beef noodle soup a few times and its pretty consistent.  The broth, although dark, is not very salty (the times that I've had it anyway) and had a good flavor.  The beef is very tender and melts in your mouth.   I've also tried their wonton soup, which is good, but pales in comparison to the beef noodle soup.  I wish they had siracha there - it would make my soup complete (but that's just my personal taste).\n \nIf you're in the mood for rice, don't hesitate to try to the pork chop over rice.  A breaded pork chop and it comes with some minced pork over the rice.  Very good!  I like to take the extra beef from my soup and eat it with the rice.\n \nThe place itself is pretty modest.  Nice service and normally quick, although last time we were here they forgot to give me my side of rice until the end of my meal when it was already pointless.  But I like the food so that's what keeps me coming back!\n \nMy only gripe is that they take cash only (which is inconvenient for a person that doesn't carry cash!).  Instead of going to an ATM, just walk over to the Ranch 99, buy something small, and get some cash back. \n \nAnyway, a solid noodle spot.

Next time,  I'll try another sandwich but my soup made up for it!!  \n\nStaff was really nice and made suggestions.  Restaurant is clean and welcoming.  \n\nDefinitely going back!", "date": "2018-10-11 19:49:57"}

Food is good, not exceptional but good, affordable and the chef's are for the most part great.  Wait staff is ok, they are not attentive except for one woman who is great and dances with the birthday music. My biggest complaint is the wait, sometimes you have to wait at your table for an hour or longer to get the cook to your table. I am sure it is unpredictable how busy it will be but with small children this makes for a not so enjoyable night.  I also think the place could be cleaner, the chairs are very sticky. The place definitely could be cleaner. These days it seems like the wait gets longer because they have less or all new cooks.  Cleanliness is an issue, the chairs and carpet is very sticky.", "date": "2013-11-26 19:13:42"}

I mean where else can you finally go with your health food waiting in the wings for you (mmm wings, damn eating healthy). Everything you need is here if you're trying to slim down, following Paleo, like eating healthy, or are in to getting more than just the typical bland smoothie. The setup is clean, the service is nothing short of excellent and I will definitely be going back. The only reason I couldn't give it five stars is because the portion sizes are always inconsistent. One visit I'll get a perfectly sized chicken breast or bison meat, the next time the meat is barely enough to qualify as a snack for a five year old at recess. Some type of uniformity here so I know whether to order extra meat or not would help.\n\nRegardless, the shakes are good and the food is delicious.  And the place is really a 4.5 it's just that this place has to be scored on a scale. When I eat at some places I think wow this food is amazing because A) the process to make was long and complex so I needed someone else to just make it B) it would be hard to find those ingredients to make it or C) it's something new that I have no idea how to make. This place doesn't apply to either of those criteria, its basic and you can make it yourself if you have the time and its going to taste exactly how you think its going to taste. (Chicken, asparagus and couscous - there's no surprise here you know what it's going to taste like but hey its good and if you want to stray away from basic the wraps and hamburger will do the trick). BUT this is not a knock on the place because I will be here every week attempting to counter the fried cheese bacon dough thingamajig I will probably have every weekend. And their juices and smoothies are actually different from what you'll find around town and actually have me feeling better after I down one so even if you hate eating healthy, their juice and smoothies are still worth the trip.", "date": "2011-11-16 23:13:54"}

This place is on point with presentation. I feel its casual up scale dining. But getting back to the beginning..\n\nWalking in this place is large and gorgeous. Lots of space, modern decor and a type of kitchen view in which you can almost watch the cooks prepare your food. I am impressed with this because then I feel as if they are not hiding anything. I decided to sit at the bar.\n\nMy server was Naomi who serving me at the bar. They had sports on and also another criminal investigative show which was really interesting. There was another server Carla who would drop by to ask how my meal was and if I needed anything. It was nice to have such prompt servers who cared how my meal was and if I was content. Naomi recommended their homemade pomegranate soda. Very refreshing, not too sweet.\n\nLet's start with my favorite dish to compare to the many I've had from other restaurants.. Calamari. Light fry coating. Perfect. I can't stand when the calamari is greasy, it's seafood and supposed to be light. Calamari wasn't fishy, and it was paired perfectly with mint, tomato julienne, lemon to garnish and their tangy sauce. You had to really get all three in one bite to capture the flavor. \n\nUltimately I decided to go with something outside of my comfort zone. Be different. Be unique. My choice? Brussel sprouts. YUCK! But your not going to believe it.... these brussel sprouts were to dye for. BEST BRUSSEL SPROUTS EVER. did I really just say that? YES. They had this delicious sweet sauce, bacon and pears. What a combination. my mind was blown, sweet and salty. Please go try those. I will come back just to get my brussel sprout fix. \n\nNext I choose the mushroom fries.. I cant remember their exact name but it was just as delicious as the sprouts. I'm not a mushroom fan but the waitress recommended them, so why not. I asked for ti on the side as a safety precaution. It was very rich mushroom but not the type of mushroom flavor I was expecting. I found myself constantly dipping them. I saw on the menu they had a homemade pineapple ketchup so I asked for a side of that as well. Sssh, don't rat me out but I ended up taking that home because it was the best ketchup ever. I'm going to have to find a way to recreate it.\n\nLastly I went with another third item out of my comfort zone... fish sandwich. Side note, I'm not a fan of lots of onions so when it came to my bar spot I almost dyed. I kept thinking of my breath and the fact I wouldn't be able to kiss my boyfriend for days. Carla reassured me that the onions had a mild taste because they soak them. Well, they hadn't done me wrong yet so in I dived in the fish. Whoa! She was right, the onions were mild, yet crunchy.. gave it an amazing texture. The fish had a sweet but tangy sauce on it and really pulled it together. I've had fish at other restaurants in which once you bite into it, the fish falls to pieces. Not this one. This fish was a champ and determined to not disappoint. \n\nLastly, the portions are ginormous, I couldn't finish everything. I almost felt like letting the waitresses know I felt they were too big. Like, I the customer was ripping off the restaurant for the size of food I was receiving. Great prices for what you get. I walked out like a bloated whale and almost had to unzip my pants. I probably would have but my shirt was too short so I had to suck it up. Next time I shall order less and get dessert. The bread pudding Naomi said was to dye for.", "date": "2015-09-13 03:17:38"}

We went late on a Friday for lunch, and left so full that I had to skip dinner.  By only taking a single bite out of every dish, I managed to try 33 of them - and there were probably twice as many that I had to skip.  I can say that while the meats were generally dry - maybe a result of the buffet having been open for 3 hours before we got there -, the dishes almost universally had very good flavor.  The two things I would skip altogether were the potato pancakes, which tasted as if they'd been in the fridge uncovered for a while, and the chocolate cream pie, which lack chocolate flavor.  Everything else went from good to delicious.\n\nThe stars of the buffet are the kalbi short ribs (in the Hawaiian section) and the Delmonico potatoes in a blue-cheese sauce.  If you were served those in a five star restaurant, you'd leave happy.  For dessert, don't miss the warm, moist, perfect bread pudding.  Just don't be a fool and add either of the overly sweet, otherwise flavorless sauces.  The pudding is wonderful by itself.\n\nOther recommendations are any of the Thai curries (refreshing and authentic, the pork loin and madagascar beef, both in mustard cream sauces) and the tri-tip, which is marinated in a chimichurri-like sauce.  \n\nLunch prices are very reasonable, $8 for adults if you get a free Palms players club card.  Kids, however, are $10.   There are coupons at restaurant.com and travelzoo for perhaps better deals.\n\nNote, even though this buffet opens to the casino, the air was perfectly breathable and our meal felt relaxing.", "date": "2013-08-03 05:56:02"}

Luckily I parked on the 3rd floor so not such a bad work but I felt bad for the family with babies who waited 10 minutes with me to figure out the elevators didn't work. The very least they could have done was put a sign up that said \"Out of Order .\" Also only one cone in front of the door on the downstairs first floor, leads you to believe only one is not working. Also, the escalator to the monorail was broken. Whoa now that is not  fun flight of stairs to climb up or down. \n\nI also have to complain about the pool. First, the tiles in front of the entrance to the pool are slippery as heck.  I almost cracked my head open when I went for a quick ride lol, but seriously someone can really hurt themselves, especially with all the alcohol being purchased at the pool.  Second, we asked 3 different people for a server so we could order some food at the pool. After an hour of being told someone will be right over, we got out of the pool and left to go get some dinner. Third, not letting you take towels to the room after you are done is not cool. Its not very classy to have people dripping water all down the hallway and into the elevators to the rooms. \n\nI did like the design of the rooms and the way they redid the hotel.

The habanero sauce and the roasted pepper on the burger gave it a sweet and spicy taste that made it not only bearable, but enjoyable.

The Japanese go to these establishments after work to have good food and good beer and sake! I want to say like Japanese tapas in a more casual atmosphere. Not typical bar food either. THIS IS NOT WINGS AND FRIES! Also.. There's nothing wrong with wings and fries.. they even serve wings here..\n\nAnyways! \n\nI feel like the phrase Izakaya is becoming trendy  in Las Vegas with some new businesses opening up but I'd say Hachi is the real deal. They have a coal grill with house made tare sauce to boot! Classic Izakaya move! Sit at the bar for a more legit experience. Another staple at an Izakaya is their fresh fish and sushi! Hachi has this down pat also.\n\nHonestly I'm no Izakaya expert but I have used Izakaya quite frequently in this review.\n\nHachi is a late night spot. It's located in one of the most densely populated plaza with awesome places. The parking is ridiculous there tbh and there's so many good restaurants. \n\nThey have a late night special for dollar oysters. They use real wasabi on it and do very little else to it and their oysters are delicious. They don't cover up the natural flavor with sriracha and ponzu-THERES NOTHING WRONG WITH PONZU ON OYSTERS IM JUST SAYING!  Their items grilled on the coal grill with tare are amazing also. I recommend wagyu tongue, tasukune with poached egg, and their chicken thigh. \n\nOne of their signature dishes, the Hachi salad, is also super unique with a tangy vinaigrette, karage, and served in a crisp batter bowl. Hard to explain but super unique and delicious.\n\nWe also had their salmon belly, garlic tuna, and tako wasabi which is octopus marinated in wasabi.\n\nOne dish that was a miss for me was the sukiyaki hot pot. I thought it was overly sweet and one dimensional. \n\nThe takoyaki was a stand out for me. Like at Jinya  they serve there's over egg salad. The takoyaki itself was so crisp on the outside and each had a substantial piece of octopus in it.\n\nService was good. I like the way they pace your dishes. They have at least six wait staff cleaning up finished plates, refilling drinks, and taking new orders. They were really good at suggestions also. I recommend ordering all at once tbh. \n\nI like the atmosphere. It's dark and wooden and comfortable. The staff all greet you and dismiss you in unison which is funny.\n\nThey have a good variety of food. I recommend you stick to the seafood and grill for sure. Overall I really enjoy Hachi. I thought the pricing was really fair considering the quality of food. It's a good place to knock a few beers back and have some tasty food that isn't too fussy. I didn't give them five stars because nothing wowed me food wise. Everything was good but I have a couple places in town in the same field I'd choose over Hachi.", "date": "2018-07-14 07:18:28"}

I already knew from the start that it cannot compare to LA where we live but I'm optimistic when it comes to food. Being a born and raised in Vegas I know the food competition is fierce. So let me review...\n\nFirst this place is a tad on the pricy side for what you get. Portions are not that big for what they are charging. I guess we are used to the LA and OC sushi places we normally eat at. But the food does taste fresh and is well made. \n\nThe Sashimi was fresh and the best thing we had there. Got the Salmon, Smoked Salmon and the fatty Tuna, aka Toro Tuna. But again a little pricy for what you get. \n\nThe Grilled Salmon was good and fresh. Came on a bed of tempura and teriyaki sauce. Simple yet good dish. \n\nThe Roppongi roll was fair. For $15.00 I was expecting a little more of a spectacular taste but it was average. I've had better signature rolls from other Sushi joints. This was supposed to be one of their best and most popular rolls but we thought it was mediocre at best. \n\nWhat we did like was the Fresh Wasabi that came with the Sashimi. First time I've had that in a sushi place in Vegas. \n\nFinally the Katsu Curry was very tasty and a decent sized portion. It's definitely not on the generous portion size that you would get in LA. But still good. \n\nWe were surprised this place was open so late because we were the only ones in there haha. It was a desolate Thursday night with no cars on the road or other guests inside. \n\nServer was very friendly and attentive. The chefs seemed to be a little on the shy and quiet side.", "date": "2016-04-22 08:32:32"}

And I've noticed the chefs are more interactive with the guests in general compared to other places I've been.\n\nThe price of my hibachi dinner was under twenty dollars. As long as I can contain the amount of sake and Sapporos that I consume, my wife and I can get out of here full and paying around $60 for dinner which price I like and will keep us coming back on a regular basis.", "date": "2016-02-13 17:20:10"}

(I'm a HUGE boba enthusiast so it's saying a lot)\nI'm so surprised this is my first time coming here! I really admire how you can get the option of which percentage of sweetness you'd like, i got mine 70% less sweet. \n\nThe parking location/plaza wasn't bad, I came here around 8-9pm so the business around it were either empty or closed so there was parking in front. The store inside has an adorable nature woody themed to it, and it was a really relaxing environment. I wouldn't recommend it for students to study here because it's a bit nosy with people talking and music. And it's a bit small so finding tables can be hard if it's crowded too.\n\nThe staffs are ALL so welcoming and super duper fast paced! Customer service is key and they are efficient. They make the drinks so fast and always keep busy. When i went there was a line and all the tables and chairs were taken, that just shows how amazing their drinks really are. No wonder why they have such good reviews on yelp because this place deserves it! \n\nI literally have a note pad on my phone of the drinks i want to try next time i go! (Next up.. tea, slush, and crepes!!) Hehe I also LOVE how they offer a loyalty star and for my opinion they have more option choices than normal boba shops variety wise. \n\nWhat we tried was.. \n\nCoconut Milk tea: Not too sweet, perf. coconut flavor not too overwhelming and refreshing \n\nTaro Milk tea: The REAL DEAL, you can taste the blended taro in this, NOT POWDER! \n\nHokkaido Milk tea: (FAVE) sweet latte vanilla flavor \n\nALL the drinks have AMAZING CHEWY tapioca balls (boba) i'm always so picky if my boba is too hard or isn't flavorful and theirs is sweet, soft, chewy & perfect! \n\nHighly recommend! 10/10 if you don't love boba still come here it'll change your mind!!", "date": "2018-02-24 14:28:02"}

Come here to watch the big game...especially if you are placing a bet and need a casino to do so.  I would much rather watch the game here with great beer and good food than in a sports book.  Also, come here if you are staying at the the Luxor and need some more reasonable strip dinner prices.\n\nThe name throws me a bit...I was hoping for a traditional public house throwback.  The sports bar feel is not the typical bar I am looking for unless I am with a group of friends watching the game.  The Public House  does it well though.  I posted a couple of pictures of their beer menu...not your typical sports bar varieties.  Some might even call it a best of Yard House type selection.\n\nSome highlights were the Philly Cheesesteak Spring Rolls (although again the names are killing me a little bit....In America we tend to use \"Spring Roll\" to refer to soft rice paper wrapped rolls more often than fried won ton wrapped rolls...why not just call them crunchy Philly Cheessteak Rolls?...delicious non-the-less.)  The bartender suggested a side of the honey bourbon sauce for dipping...this was a good choice since bark would taste great dipped in this sauce!  I was also a fan of the the hummus plate.  It comes with a great plate of items, rather than just hummus and pita.  The olive and red pepper salad on the hummus plate is great!...there is also feta and cucumbers!  The filet mingon sliders rock.  You get three sliders with tender chunks of filet mingon.  I ordered mine with sweet potato fries and was quite pleased.\n\nThe mac-n-cheese squares are fired squares of mac-n-cheese.  There are a little dry on their own, but they come with an amazing side of chilpolte ranch...so if you dredge the squares through the chipolte ranch something special happens in your mouth...although something not-so-special probably also happens around your waist.\n \nI want to try the pulled pork next time.\n\nIt was a bit loud with Monday Night Football on for my usual liking.

I mean I adore a lot of people on Yelp, but I'm particularly lucky to have met Jieun L, Anthony M., Elnino F, and Andy T who cared \nenough to get me out of the house and get me out of my birthday funk.

Yeah there are setbacks like any spots but drink selections make me happy so it was a good choice to turn around any bad day. Our server (Mitch) was pretty good in service, had good beer recommendations and he also brought me a happy birthday brownie sundae (yay!). Nachos were pretty good and loaded with stuff. Sweet potato fries maple bacon sauce was delish that I want to pour that on just about every breakfast item. Ceviche spoons were fresh and light. Chicken garlic noodles- good but go for the plain garlic noodles. There was chicken, tofu, mushrooms, edamame, asparagus, chives, garlic, cheese and it's too much at once. Simple is better with garlic noodles.\n\nBF found a favorite beer worth mentioning- Rogue Dry Hopped Red. Smooth with a bit of hops...a good choice to baby step into the IPAs and DIPAs. He liked it much so that we went back 4days later to order this beer again...we never order twice since our goal is to drink down the whole list (past halfway). \n\nA few drinks and plates in we were laughing so hard that I was snorting. I mean, I like never do that unless I'm really fighting hard to stop laughing. Anthony has awesome one liners. Jieun makes funny beer faces. Elnino is a violent funny drunk. My BF coined some T-shirt worthy terms at the table. Andy is just a G and always for a good time. \n\nI expected to go home from work, eat lunch and stay home alone until my BF can get off, head to dinner and go sleep and forget about the day even being my birthday. \n\nEverything is alright when you have good company to make you smile.", "date": "2010-11-17 09:41:29"}

I had friends rave that it's the best buffet in Vegas...so we waited. It was more like an hour and a half before we were seated. \n\nThe decor is lovely with colourful (albeit fake) flowers and the room is very bright with natural light. \n\nI started with breakfast foods. Eggs Benedict was good, but I prefer the Bellagios hollandaise. Omelette made to order was the best part of the breakfast selections. Weirdly no type of breakfast potato or hash brown. (Actually now thinking back no potatoes of any kind at the carving station either). There was a fruit and yogurt bar for lighter choices and interesting little carafes of juices like watermelon ginger.\n\nReturned to the table to find juice and coffee. OJ was fresh. Coffee not so much. \n\nFor the lunch options I tried their roast beef. The carver was spaced out and I had to ask repeatedly for a med-rare piece. He first placed well done on my plate without looking at me or listening to what I was saying. The piece I got was pretty good. I also tried their charcuterie board that had some nice salami and pickles.\n\nBy the time we got to the dessert station we were too full to enjoy.

Well- my stars aren't changing... (brrr). I was very hungry and ordered the black garlic ramen based on other reviews here and their \"chicken\" karaage. I quote \"chicken\" because I surmise there MAY have been a scrap or two of flesh somewhere in the small pile of over-fried, greasy, thick, unsalted, tasteless clumps. They were crisp and then as you got to the center oil flavor just kept coming. I even bit experimentally into 1-2 of the larger pieces looking for meat, and only saw thick, oil-soaked batter. Got queasy. Decided to move on to the soup, which incidentally, they served to me a good 5 minutes before the appetizer, with no utensils (someone else, not my waiter, noticed I was sitting there with a bowl of hot ramen and no chopsticks and did bring a pair over with an embarrassed chuckle). First thing- the entire surface of the broth was encased in oil. I've had delicious, deeply flavorsome black garlic ramen at other places in town and it's always garlic oil DROPS floating on the surface, with fried garlic slices. This was a veritable layer of oil on top and the fried garlic and shallots? onions? in the broth were exceedingly bitter. The brother had decent flavor but tasted weak, like it was watered down. As I was sitting at the bar trying to eat, my neighbor to the right, a lady, kept exclaiming to her dining partner that her broth was \"so salty, way too salty, yes, too salty for my taste\" and finally pushed it away. My final disappointment was the noodles. They weren't the same as the ramen noodles served last time, which was the one redeeming quality of the horrible seafood ramen I ordered last visit and a point of positivity that I was looking forward to. They were white, and looked and felt like thinner rice noodles, definitely over boiled with none of the fresh bounce and chew and yellow color that I noticed last time. All in all, to say I regret spending $18 here (yes, I tipped the waiter $2 though he never checked on me once after he took my order) is an understatement and I definitely won't be back. Save your money for gas and drive to Chinatown- Ramen Sora, Monta, or even Sapporo Revolving Sushi which unexpectedly has the best black garlic broth I have tasted recently.\n\n............\n\nThis was literally one of the worst meals I have had in a while. I should've re-evaluated my choice to order the tomato broth seafood ramen when most Ramen places are known for their Tonkatsu, but I wanted to have something a little lighter for lunch. I also ordered their tempura appetizer which was a shrimp/ veggie combo. So... the ramen. It came looking like a jumble of noodles and vague ingredients in a liquid that smelled and looked very startlingly like Campbell's tomatoes soup. Not nicely laid out with ingredients on top, and I could see chunks of raw onion, which was not listed on the ingredients. I poked into it, and a sweet-tomato-seafood smell wafted up. I don't know what I was expecting, but the sweet, super salty, almost ketchupy taste was not it. The ingredients were spare, but I just couldn't get over the broth. To make things worth, I had ordered extra broth like I usually do and I was completely enveloped in this sweet salty tomato soup smell. The tempura didn't fare any better- no light crispy batter here, it was heavily battered, almost like a thick beer batter, and the shrimp were tiny- the vegetables a joke (one of them was a heavily battered single green bean) and to add insult to injury, the tempura sauce was super salty as well. My 2 stars are only for the cleanliness, decent service, and texture of the noodles, which were decently springy and chewy even being the thin style of ramen noodleGiven we don't have ramen options at all in the north, in sheer desperation I may come back to try the regular tonkatsu broth / meat options, but take my word for it- steer clear of the seafood option and the tempura!", "date": "2018-05-10 02:51:46"}

I have perhaps one of the best doctors I've ever had or would have left this clinic long ago. I have documentation on everything I'm about to say. I have a severe case of atopic dermatitis and the suffering is unimaginable. Not once but twice they have sent my records to the wrong insurance. This is after I did everything possible to be sure it was done correctly. Multiple times, I had told them that I called personally to check on what they did, only to find that they had screwed up. Still they would not believe me and insisted they did it right. Again, I would follow up to be sure and would tell them they sent it wrong again. They told me I did not know what I was talking about, and each time, they were wrong. People say they are going to call back and they don't. You try to help them by correcting them and they don't believe you. I cannot find anyone higher up to file a complaint with. So, I will be submitting a complaint to, Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners on Monday. This condition I have is brutal and I've had it for over three and half years. Last Tuesday they finally realized they sent it to the wrong place. This is after I've been telling them for nearly two weeks and every single day, you didn't do it right. Now, I've been suffering going on three weeks and nothing has been done. I went too the office myself and demanded my records and faxed it myself to the correct people. Extreme itching, skin oozing and pain is constant. This goes on 24/7 and there is not a break. Dr. Herman is an amazing and I have recommended him to many friends who agree he is one of the best doctors they have ever seen. The outfit he works for is pathetic. They either over work these people, don't train them properly and have no follow up. They do these stupid questionnaires that are limited in scope and do not address the real issues.

I finalized my order to a regular sized half COTTON CANDY & half LYCHEE (I figured the combo made more sense, although the green tea was amazing as well!) topped with MOCHI & LYCHEE BOBA.

I'm not a huge fan of thin slice but it was good. The special pizza I got had a good amount of toppings. No complaints on taste! \n\nThe staff was friendly. My friends originally wanted to order some beers but the girl taking their order warned them that each bottle was $21 before she rang them up. I'm glad she did because that is way too expensive IMO. She asked if it was okay and they opted not to get it. That was great because I know most places wont even tell you. \n\nI liked this place. I'm definitely gonna check it out again and would like to actually dine in the restaurant. I've read some of their other reviews so I can't wait to go again.", "date": "2014-03-25 14:10:34"}

I don't mind being surrounded by some hustle and bustle, but it was cold out - and every time someone opened the door out to the patio, we got hit with a blast of freezing cold air at our table.  Just a crowded restaurant trying to maximize space I guess.\n\nBeer selection is great - I forgot my reading glasses this time so I couldn't actually READ the menu, so I just went with a Stella.   For food I got the Ahi Crunchy Salad with field greens, asian slaw and crispy wontons tossed in soy vinaigrette (according to the menu) - it was quite good.  \n\nI'm a HUGE fan of al fresco hanging out / drinking / eating, and I'm glad to see that more places in Vegas are embracing it, so I'll probably be back later in the year when it gets a bit warmer and try the patio.", "date": "2011-02-27 18:03:54"}

Whoops!  Not so any longer.  This $5.99 special is now a thin patty with no drippy cheese & shredded lettuce smothering it, but does sit atop that Brioche bun.  I ordered the fish & chips special & was shocked to find 2 thin pieces of over-breaded fish & decided Gorton's fish sticks were way better.

They did have a very good Asian chicken salad but now it has all cabbage instead of any lettuce (duh).\n\nWhy does a huge operation such as this continue to be low-grade?

I find spending $15 anywhere else, I can lift the packaged products with my eyelashes. \nI will suggest to Aurelio's that they invest some belief in their own cuisine. Chicago-style is beast.

I'd been wanting to try it ever since it opened, so much so that it became a running joke between me and my dining partner in crime (henceforth PIC) that I would always suggest \"Bon Chef?\" as an option when asked where we should eat.   This continued for the last 6-8 months with nary a single visit.  When the PIC actually brought it up as a serious suggestion to eat dinner last week, I almost hesitated for fear of losing this running joke.   In the end I agreed we should finally try it and off we went.\n\nWe started with some beers which seemed to take a while to be delivered.  They had a decent selection of bottles to choose from, but after ordering the wait got to the point where I was looking around and annoyingly asking the PIC \"Where the hell are our beers?\"  Then, refills had to be requested by flagging down our server 5 minutes after my glass sat empty, and my PIC who ordered a Guinness was told upon trying to order another that they were out.   Not a huge deal and they supplanted it with another German dark beer, but a mild annoyance.\n\nI'd been craving (and missing) Hedary's lentil soup for some time now, and when I saw Lentil Soup on the menu here I had to order it.   It was decent.   Lentil soups from my experience vary wildly from restaurant to restaurant and this one neither pleased nor displeased me.   Not something I'd rush to order again but I wouldn't push it away if presented it either.\n\nAs for the entrees my PIC got the steak Pyramid which I'd been hyping up since Bon Chef opened, and I went with the Mixed Grill because I always tend to order plates with way too much food (this boasted chicken, beef, kofta, and a pork chop over rice).   In the end I have to say I was very disappointed with my dish.   I ordered my beef to be done \"medium\" and felt that ALL the meat came out medium-well to well.   Most of it was dry and tough and lacked seasoning.  The one exception was the Kofta, which I thought had a great flavor and didn't seem as dry as the others.   The rice that accompanied it was fine, but I've certainly had better at other Mediterranean restaurants I frequent (shout out to Stephanos and Fat Greek).   My PIC's steak pyramid was much better, perhaps because she had the wherewithal to go medium rare on the cook.   Her steak was juicier and more tender than mine, though the flavor on it due to the marinade they used wasn't something that I liked much.   She was a fan though.   Unfortunately I'm writing this review and not her.  \n\nFor food alone I would have probably gone with a 3 if everything else was perfect, but with the slow service on getting drinks and refills, the one bottle of Guinness caper, as well as what I feel are slightly high prices for what you get in return, the end result is a 2.  I might just be bitter for losing my long running joke with this visit.  Turns out the joke was on me all along.", "date": "2013-09-19 17:47:17"}

So this was my first time at Buffalo Wild Wings. I have seen the commercials about the customers not wanting to leaving and talking to the referee about extending the game. I did not think it was that great that i wanted to stay longer there. I know it's a commercial, but i would call it false advertising. lol. \n\nSo it was a Tuesday and apparently they have cheap wings on this day. You can go with one sauce or with multiple. The minimum per sauce was 3 so i got 5 Hot BBQ, 5 mild, and 5 Honey BBQ. I didn't want to fill myself up too much because there are so many places to eat in Vegas. My friend got the hot mango one and it was pretty spicy and left the lips burning a little bit. But it had good flavor so it was worth the burn the second time. \n\nThe service was alright...except she forgot 5 of my friend's wings. lol. I guess our order was too confusing or something. It took a while though to get my change from the bill.... but they were a little busy so it was understandable. I do not like to hate on restaurants.

I say \"was\" because it used to be called the Planet Hollywood Towers but has since been rebranded and is now managed by Hilton, dubbed the \"Elara - a Hilton Grand Vacations Resort.\"  But other than the name change, everything else remained the same.

It's connected to the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino via the Miracle Mile Shops and has it's own private entrance.  Parking is $15/day.  The lobby is beautiful and smoke free.  Because it's a non gaming hotel, there are no slots or tables located on the main floor.  Less people milling around means less smoke in the air.  Kinda nice.  You have to walk over to Planet Hollywood if you want to throw your money away.   \n\nThe rooms are huge with floor to ceiling windows, a kitchenette area including microwave, mini fridge, plates, silverware and coffee maker.  The bathrooms are decent size with Jacuzzi tubs and separate toilet area.  Just imagine a nicer Planet Hollywood room.  It's not amazing by any means but it's definitely nice for a mid-tier hotel.  \n\nNow this is not a party hotel so don't stay here if you're looking to go full on rage mode.

They whisked us up to our rooms via a service elevator and helped us get to our rooms.  We didn't have to deal with the general public and wait in normal elevators.

The classes have been hitting the bags and light sparring and other days are  boot camp/hiit style workouts.  I was really happy they added 5 am classes and hope more days are added as it works better with my schedule.  Those classes are more weight training, almost CrossFit style. The classes are definitely different from years ago, but it does give variety to change up the same routine.\n\nThey also have a 6 week challenge which has become popular in the fitness world in general and I think it's a new concept at this  gym.  I'm NOT in the challenge.  Let's get this straight, it's not free, you must put up money to be on the challenge.  You can look at it as incentive for you to reach your goals, but remember that money has to be upfront.  If you need to be held accountable to lose weight, then this might be a good route. OR you can just join and realize your monthly is your accountability to get to the gym.\n\nThe rates are a bit high for month to month.  When you join you pay first and last month and if you leave, you must give 30 day notice. Your payments really end 60 days later.  I made sure I understood those terms and you should too.  \n\nI decided to rejoin because its conveniently closer for me and I enjoy hitting the bags, I miss hitting mitts more, but I'm here to better me after having two little ones.

The meat was tender and had so much flavor, I didn't need any sauce. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the Milk Chocolate Souffl\u00e9, which took 10 mins to make, and well worth the wait. We also ordered the Sorbet - consisted of 3 flavors (Mango, Lemon 'Lemonade' and some sort of berry) with fresh strawberries and berries. Amazing.

You need something that stands out to make your donut shop - 'worth a journey'.  At Donut bar, they've got TWO things that I gladly journey out for - their ice cream donut, and their creme brulee donut.  That's not even mentioning their other donuts (strawberry, vanilla bean, maple bacon) that are full of flavourful donuty goodness and excellent in their own right.  \n\nUnlike Pinkbox, Donut bar closes when they run out of donuts.  That's usually around noon?  Depending on how picky you are about your donut options, come early.  They only make about 25 of their ice cream donuts every day, and they usually aim to have those ready by 10.  I know eating an ice cream cone at 10am in the morning feels a little strange, but it was worth it for me.\n\nI haven't had their horchata donut, but I've seen photos -- looks pretty amazing.

I of course had to be fat and order the nachos. My friend ordered some pork tacos. We sat down and waited for our food. I see them all the time and it makes me laugh but they have the posted signs for no refills or there will be an additional charge. I think we refilled our drink like 5 times and nothing was said.. I know they are trying to watch their costs and whatnot but it's like cents per cup. They also have a jukebox that randomly plays music and stares the pee out of you.

Purchased a new power sectional from the Cheyenne/Rainbow location back in November of last year. I believe it was a display item from the Market. Initially we noticed that some led lights on it wouldn't turn off, so the salesperson insisted we delay delivery an extra week so it could be fixed. I also had them check the recliners to make sure they all worked, and they did. So we waited an extra week (so 10+ days total) and when it arrived, the led lights still wouldn't turn off... and one of the power recliners wouldn't work. I  was pretty disappointed that I had waited that extra time for it still not to work, but I called the store and my sales rep arranged to have their technician come back to look at it. Several visits, he thought possibly the power adapter missing batteries might be the problem. He came back a few days later, but that didn't fix the issue.  A week or so later, my dog jumped on that side of the sofa and the recliner kicked on and opened all the way. So I called the store and the technician, and the person at the store called me to arrange to have it picked up and for me to come back and pick something else out. I never asked to have it swapped out, and told her so. We had been looking for a sofa for months, so why would I want to return it for something else? I just wanted to get it fixed. I have made umteen number of calls, spoken to numerous people about the issue and no one has ever attempted to actually resolve the issue. In the beginning people would call me back, to tell me they were trying to get in touch with Colleen to offer me some resolution... but that has never happened. Over the months, every day or so when my toddler or dog walk across that seat, the recliner opens up all the way, we have to pull the sofa out, unplug and replug it in to get it to close. But the manual buttons still have never once worked. So about a month ago I called and left yet another message for Amber in their main office, stating that I was incredibly upset no one would get back to me to help me get it fixed, begging her to call me back... and surprise, surpise nope...I never got a call back. Finally today I did some research and located a phone number for the manufacturer and called them, they immediately offered to send out a part that will hopefully fix my issue. I dont understand why Colleen's didn't attempt this, or heck even just give me their contact information to call myself. It's such a shame. My sales rep Alaina was awesome, the staff has always been friendly... but they need to work on handling customer issues. I should never have had to make so many phone calls without ever getting any resolution. They could have easily just passed along the manufacturers information and suggested I contact them for warranty repair.

They seated us in 40 minutes, I didn't mind the wait because we did have a big party but I thought the service was bad.\nI've been here several times before and I love the ropa vieja sandwich and any of their flavored lemonades. I ordered the ropa vieja sandwich again. It came out in a reasonable time, but it tasted awful. The bread tasted like it was old or like the sandwich was microwaved. Normally the meat is tender but this time it was tough and it almost hurt my jaw to chew it, and certain parts of the sandwich were cold. My raspberry lemon breeze tasted like it was powdery and way too sweet. Our waitress was nice but she didn't come back until it was time for dessert. We ordered a key lime pie. If you like eating straight up sugar, you'll love this dessert. The crust tastes like hardened brown sugar, it melts in your mouth. Which I would like, but it was way too sweet. \nNeedless to say, I'm not sure I will come back to Bahama Breeze. Or at least not with a group or when it's busy.

There were some high notes, but also some low.  We shared the popcorn shrimp, tuna tartare and stuffed mushrooms to start off with. The popcorn shrimp was really good! I love the dipping sauce it was served with. Served ever so cutely in a popcorn box, which I read that some called it tacky, but I thought it was uber cute! The tuna tartare was another favorite. Fresh and delicious. Stuffed mushrooms were good, but my least favorite out of the three. \n\nNext came our caesar salad. No complaints here! Served with a crispy parmesan toast and a little piece of smoky bacon that was just perfect. We then shared the chicken, rib eye steak, linguini pasta for our entrees and for our sides we had the potato gnocchi and asparagus. The highlight for me was probably the chicken. It had a nice spice to it. It was served in some sort of jalapeno lemon sauce that was seriously good! The steak on the other hand didn't really blow me away. I asked for medium rare and it came out rare. I know it's a very small scale from the two but I just don't like my steak that red. Flavors of the steak was okay, I thought it lacked a little seasoning. But I guess what my steak lack, it made with in the pasta. It was so overly salty. I wasn't a huge fan. But when eaten in the same bite, it wasn't too bad. It was my first time trying gnocchi and it was kind weird. I just don't think I'm a fan of gnocchi in general so I can't really critique it. \n\nThen for dessert we roasted some s'mores at our table, which was really fun and a great presentation. We also had some carrot cake which I heard my girlfriend say was dry but I was already too stuffed to the gills to even try. \n\nOverall, my meal was pretty good.

And they maintain a long line so it discourages you to cash out (was a 15 minute wait) one time.  Slots are also very tight, worst I've seen in Vegas after trying 20-30 machines, never won a dollar or ever got above what I bought in... Learning lesson.

The ribs, chicken and everything else is excellent, but the above dishes were my favorites.\n\nLas Vegas is frankly very lucky to have BBQ of this caliber, as very few cities in America do. The manager is super friendly, and the whole staff is very friendly and accommodating.

Luckily this place wasn't very busy when I arrived for lunch, so I was able to sit at a table.  The service was very good, which is typical of Japanese restaurants.  I ordered their pork cutlet curry on rice and a side order of chicken katsu. Their curry sauce is quite good, but I would have preferred a little bit more curry sauce.  I also tried their curry pan and it was delicious.  This deep fried panko bun with curry inside would have been perfect had it been a little bit warmer.

Prepare to get pushed, shoved, bumped into, and accidentally hit. This shit show is at it's absolute best and worst when they do the XIV, a neon party (which is one Sunday a month and stars at 5 PM). No joke. You can't ask for a better party pit, but the only way to thoroughly enjoy this space is to have a table. MUST have a table. Seriously. MUST.\n\nWhen it's not the overly packed, the space feels a lot like an upscale lounge. Stunning views of the Bellagio fountains and the surrounding strip area. The music here various from Top 40 to EDM.\n\nCover and drink prices are on par with other strip club/lounge pricing. Look for a promoter on Twitter or Facebook.", "date": "2013-12-17 10:43:08"}

I knew after my first visit that I will be back again and again and again.  The service is great and if there's a wait, it usually doesn't take too long for us to be seated.  My favorite dish at M&M is their smothered baked chicken.  This dish is hooked up with big pieces of perfectly baked chicken smothered with gravy.  I'll usually get a full order and it comes with 3 sides.  My sides is pretty much the same every time...cornbread dressing, the yams, and red bean & rice.  My entire meal is big enough to feed two people. But it's so good that I will finish the entire meal on my own.  Most of the Yelpers I know rave about their chicken & waffles.  The chicken is fried to perfection and seasoned just right.  I highly recommend their chicken & waffles if it's your first time.  In my opinion, M&M is the best place for soul food in Las Vegas. \n\n2017 Yelp Review #64", "date": "2017-01-21 00:58:48"}

I ended up entering and the hostess who was very nice told me that she'd have me seated in 5 minutes. \n\nAfter I was seated I was promptly greeted by my waitress Kylee R. she was very friendly and accommodating and even though I was by myself she made me feel welcome. \n\nI ordered an Ice tea which had tropical flavorings added it seemed bitter at first but sugar made it taste way better.\n\nI went with the butternut squash soup based on Kylee's Recommendation and I have to agree that it was very fantastic, flavorful and you could taste that hint of honey and truffle in the background of the main ingredients. I liked it.\n\nI of course had to choose the Free Range Petaluma Organic Hand carved Roast Turkey Dinner that came with White and Dark Roasted Turkey, Giblet Gravy, Sweet sausage stuffing, roasted Brussels sprouts, haricot vert, mashed potato and brown sugar sweet potatoes since it didn't seem right to order a steak tonight. \n\nThe turkey was melt-in-your mouth delicious, and the giblet gravy was fantastic. I of course asked for an extra helping of gravy because I'm one of those people that likes to make sure it's dead and drowned in the stuff!\n\nI found the 'sweet' sausage stuffing to be abnormally spicy though and it actually put a stop to my dinner for a moment as I must have gotten a really spicy piece of sausage that managed to make it's way into the 'sweet' batch... Either that or TODD is trying to be unique by saying it's \"sweet\" and instead watching you spit fire while he giggles in his office watching the cameras.... \n\nThe mashed taters sweet potatoes Brussels Sprouts and Haricot Vert were good and flavorful as well. My only gripe is that it says \"sprouts\" and not sprout! I could have eaten another three or twenty of them, it was that good! \n\nDessert was a Crisp Cinnamon Apple Tart and Pumpkin Pie Timbale which both were of course fantastic and I was stuffed and finished at the end of this... \n\nSo why the 1 star off you might be asking? well it's quite simple... I am not a fan of loud boisterous cursing every minute (GD this and GD that and F this and No S that.) there was a table with an extremely loud overly intoxicated individual that was clearly thinking that he was at his house instead of out in public and none of the employees let him know that his language or boisterous exaggerations were inappropriate. there should have been some kind of customer control going on there, Kylee had mentioned it and apologized to me that it was happening before I left and I accepted it and thanked her very much.\n\nOverall-This experience was great though and I would like to return on a non-holiday to try the regular menu, so thanks Todd, and Kylee for providing this soul a good thanksgiving meal when it had nowhere else to go.

We had mashers and Steamed Asparagus w/ Hollandaise for sides. When the steak was revealed, I was surprised how big a New York cut can be, it was almost like a Porterhouse cut from some steakhouses! My steak was perfectly made (medium), and upon first bite the flavor form being dry-aged 21 days is absolutely present. And the presence of that flavor is still apparent up to the middle of the meat, unheard off especially on less fatty cuts of steak. I guess one trade off with have a wonderfully flavored steak is toughness. Yes, this New York cut is tougher than the usual New York cuts I have had from other restaurants. That's some tradeoff because for me, texture is equally important as flavor in steaks. Also their steamed asparagus were overcooked, less apparent (but still overcooked) when our server exchanged it for a new one. The machers were simply delicious.\n\nCombined with my buddy's uber expensive Caymus prime red wine, our dining experience at Gallagher's was awesome.

Monta is so small and doesn't have the best air conditioning to battle the heat and since the place is packed all the time, it will definitely get stuffy.

I was about to jump in there!\".\n\nWell done Paris, I'll see you next year.\n\n\nEnjoy!", "date": "2011-07-16 21:26:17"}

I think the most memorable thing about this place is that when you sit outside you get to see the Bellagio water show. I find that quite nice if you are enjoying your lunch or dinner and you get a pretty nice water show performing. \n\nFood was alright. I think if i never tried Zazie then this place might just be 4 stars but it just wasn't what I call AMAZING. I didn't expected much but for some reason I find myself leaving the place quite disappointed. I think the thing that got me the most was the fact that it was warm when the food was deliver to our table. I don't get it...the dishes should of just been cooked for us and the food is warm? If you are a pretty high up there restaurant, you just don't expect to see this kind of features. I'm just not satisfy with the fact that we were brought out with warm food. It absolutely makes no sense to me. \n\nI think the bread was very disappointing. I really hated the bread that they provided us. It just didn't meet any of my high class restaurant's bread. I mean I can go to Coco's and they can serve me better and more delicious bread than them. The bread was just plain dry and it was pretty hard to bite off a piece because it was crunch. YEA...didnt like it much. \n\nTO THE MAIN ENTREES\n\nI got the Croque Madame which was alright. After I tried Zazie, it's just alright in my book. The thing I find my Croque Madame quite oily? It's okaay i think i can kinda overlook that. I also tried the French Onion soup which was quite nice. I actually find the French onion soup the most enjoyable EXCEPT that once i dig my spoon under the cheese the soup was still quite warm. Which is a big WTF for me. I tried two other dishes but as yea I think the overall was an alright to me. \n\nService...it was a so so. At first I thought the waiter was quite nice and refreshing because it seems like he is trying to have a great convo with us. You know after the main entrees was serve to us...it was like he became a ninja and just kinda disappear. The leaving experience was a lot worst.The reason why is that we asked for the check and he just forget about it. So we were sitting there for a good 10 mins until we finally asked for it again. THEN we finally got the check and leave.\n\nIt's not a must try place in my book but I wouldn't kill myself if i had to come here again.", "date": "2010-09-18 08:41:37"}

The hotel is in the older, downtown section of Las Vegas, a ways from the strip.  Our room was in the Gold Tower.  These rooms appear to be recently remodeled.  The room was pretty spacious.  The bathroom is a little small, with only one sink.  But overall, this room was very nice.\n\nThe pool area features a large shark tank with a water slide that goes through the tank.  They also have live gaming tables in the pool area.  Obviously, in November the pool was not getting much action.  My only problem with the pool is that is surrounded by the hotel towers and does not get much direct sun.  This may be a blessing during the summer, but won't provide much of an opportunity to get some sun.  There is also a smaller party pool near the Rush tower that has multiple cabanas and a small infinity pool.\n\nThe casino is somewhat standard for Vegas, but seemed a bit cramped and smoky.  They may have been managing the number of dealers, but it seemed hard to find a blackjack table with many open seats.  \n\nAs opposed to the hotels on the strip that have famous chefs anchoring their hotels, the Nugget has brand-name restaurants, including a Chart House and Claim Jumper.  Neither of these were bad, but it wasn't the dining experience you'd get on the strip.  \n\nThe hotel opens to the Fremont Street experience.  The street has a cover that allows projection of video and periodic shows. They also have a zip line. But the real show is the street entertainers trying to earn a buck.  It is worth grabbing a drink and walking (which is legal) up and down Fremont just to take it all in.  \n\nWhile the Golden Nugget may be the best hotel downtown, it really lacks the best stuff of the strip.

The mixed reviews about the room and the unsavory looking bathtub in the room. 2. I didn't know anyone who had every stayed there 3. The fact that the website is a more than a little misleading as It shows the room pictures with a big soaking tub.\n\n Because of my skepticism and the fact the price was so low I had to double check. When I've tried to book a room in the past I called to and inquired about the big tub situation. The receptionist informed me that it was not guaranteed. This was a big red flag and very off putting to me. Therefore, I opted to stay elsewhere. This time the nice lady I spoke to when I called, I think maybe a Christina or Cynthia was so nice and explained that the possibility of me getting the type of room I wanted was high, I decided to book with Rumor.\n\n You must understand, in the past when I called, they were not very helpful or pleasant. She was, and I was so glad I booked this room. I needed 2 nights, but I didn't want to book it until I saw the room.  It was awesome, especially for the price. The customer service from the lady who checked me in on Wednesday morning was great, she was so nice and assured me that if I wanted to stay the second night she would honor the same price. We called and informed them we would be staying. We loved the fact that the pool wasn't ridiculously crowded, we even got a daybed for free. I believe it's first come. They had a cocktail waitress who was also very pleasant, she even brought us lemon waters without us even asking, which was super because I was so so hot and my bottled water was no longer cold. Our cocktails were really good and we don't do foo foo drinks. I had some refreshing cucumber concoction and my husband had a grape something or other. He loved his drink!! It was delicious! \n\nOne of the highlights of our stay was a Polynesian Party they were having by the pool. It was free admission, I believe open bar for an hour and then after some drink specials. The band was awesome! Lots of reggae.  Just very chill and great vibe! We didn't leave our room and we didn't have to. We just sat out in the balcony and enjoyed the show. I did not feel like I was in Vegas at all!\n\nSince it was Wednesday and Thursday, there was no valet and this wasn't a big deal because we were so in and out. We didn't eat at their restaurant, but we did get room service. It was a burger and I found it decent. My husband thought it was overcooked. \n\nI am planning to make this a repeat stay cation for us, especially when they have the Polynesian nights! The down sides: There were only two locations to get ice, in the lobby and one of the buildings. I don't remember which one. I had a Do Not Disturb sign on the door and they disturbed. I guess the housekeeper didn't know we were staying another night. Not so bad but annoying. There also was a bartender that my husband found very rude. I didn't encounter this individual, therefore I can't explain.\n\nOh, by the way I have to mention the free porn in the room. It was hilarious!

A couple of years ago, a ton of sushi restaurants were opening like it was going out style.  \"Hot and New\" donut places, poke bowl spots, burger joints, coffee shops, and BBQ restaurants can be found are all over Sin City.  We are definitely spoiled and the food competition here is fierce.  With all the different BBQ restaurants out here, it's very tough to determine who is best. But when it comes to a really good brisket and tri-tip, Big B's has to rank up there. \n\nNot So Short Review: \nBookmark Checked!! What the heck took me so long to eat at Big B's?  I remember reading Michael K's review about their brisket and immediately bookmarked Big B's.  This was over a year ago.  I finally got the opportunity try Big B's a couple of days ago and came back again today.  I was disappointed and impressed at the same time. I was disappointed in myself for not coming here sooner and impressed with the food. Michael K. was right about the brisket.  Big B's brisket deserves all the praise that it gets.  You get the option of lean or moist brisket.  The lean brisket is good and I didn't find it to be dry like other Yelpers have stated. The brisket is so tender that I had to eat it with a spoon. Their moist brisket is perfection if you prefer a fattier piece of meat.  If you're one of those Yelpers that thought the brisket was too dry, then get the moist brisket next time.  Another highlight for me is their Tri Tip and Beef Link.  You really can't go wrong with any of these choices. I have tried most of their sides as well.  My favorite is their creamed corn and BBQ beans.  I'll take my brisket or tri-tip and dip it into the BBQ beans.  Oh my goodness, it's good.  The prices are fair.  You'll get more bang for your buck with their multiple meat combos.  The combos come with two sides and they definitely do not skimp on the meat. \n\nThe restaurant is named after the owner Brian.  He's the Big B.  The service is great and the employees keep this place clean. The restaurant is also very spacious with picnic style benches all over the place.  Big B's is big enough to serve a large party and still quiet enough to enjoy your meal.  It took me so long to try Big B's because it's located so far from home.  Good news, though.  According to the owner, Big Brian is looking for a spot near our hood. In my opinion, Big B's has some of best brisket and tri-tip in Las Vegas. That's just my opinion.

So I ask the guy that was cleaning the tables do you offer spicy level here from 1 to 10 he said yes 1 to 5 so I told him I wanted a 5 when it came out it was not even spicy. A other thing when I got my egg roll, salad and soup with the lunch special the spoon for the soup had a stain on it like it hasn't been wash so I ask for a other spoon . Also nobody came to my assistant's till I finish my food didn't ask me for water or anything esle while I was eating. I rather go to a other thai place to go eat. There's other places that serve good thai food. I gave it 2 stars because I eat the curry and rice that was ok but not grear. There thai ice tea was good.

The wait was close to an hour, as the line was wrapping out the door and around the store. The weather was fantastic at the time, so the wait was very bearable.\n\nOrders were taken after a few questions were asked, and they had a generous buy one get one offer at the time. I ordered a Lychee Crush and a Peach Blossom.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, the Peach Blossom was quite good but the Lychee Crush was pretty terrible. My friend had one as well, and their Lychee Crush tasted much better. Inconsistency is a big issue to me when it comes to drinks, especially if they generally cost 5 dollars or more. I imagine they'd probably fix it, but I had finished it before trying my friend's (who also got the buy 1 get 1 and saved it for last).\n\nPrices are on the higher end for a drink place, especially if you get some of the add-ons. But at the same time, they have a lot of unique drinks that you won't find anywhere else. I haven't found one that I actually like enough to go back (I tried about 5 different drinks), but I'm sure a lot of people will appreciate their flair and variety.", "date": "2018-04-04 10:17:27"}

He said that he will ask the cook about the frozen chicken. At first the Cook said, that it's always served with a frozen chicken and the last times I've ordered the chicken mole, I must have not been paying attention.  I said it's sad that you think of me that poorly, but I was pretty sure he was wrong. Then, I told him that I had yelped this place before with pictures of the mole not served with a frozen chicken; I started looking through my phone, then he apologized that he just remembered that just recently they started using frozen chicken on the mole. My waiter was definitely embarrassed of his remarks, apologizing for that, then telling us that he was going to remove the mole off our bill. He asked me if I wanted anything else to eat, I said no.

I came on a Friday afternoon and there wasn't a cart in sight. I'm here with my two kids one of which has an ear infection who's crying and fussy the entire time. Hard to walk around and shop if you don't have anything to hold your kid or groceries. Walked around for a while trying to find a cart anywhere in the store but nothing. Talked to a girl named Ashley who looked to be some sort of manager and told her about the cart situation. She said and I quote \"Yeah I know we don't have enough....\" Then walked away. Meanwhile im not the only person standing around looking for something to put all their damn groceries in. Literally counted at 6 others waiting just for something to load up in. There weren't even any hand baskets. As little Ashley started to stroll away without any solution, apology, nothing... I reminded her Smith's does indeed have carts. Without bothering to even look back she replied, \"well isn't that nice of you to say. have a nice day\" and continued to walk away. This place is close but I'll take an extra couple minutes to go to Smith's from now on. This  grocery stores been dying for a long time and I can see why. All she had to say was, hey sorry we will work on getting some carts in here rather than being dismissive. Meanwhile the necessity for carts at a grocery store isn't a new thing. Maybe the cart black market has them on their list or something. Perhaps they should think about cart rationing? Or buy some more figgin carts!", "date": "2017-06-16 22:06:50"}

I visited this place three times while staying at Planet Hollywood, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and once at (ahem) maybe around 2am. At no time, sober or un-sober, was I really in any way impressed by these sandwiches. This is sort of an up-jumped Quiznos with the added bonus that the bread starts out unbaked and bakes as it's going through the conveyor belt. However the ingredients going in to the sandwich seem fairly standard for fast food quality, maybe slightly better, and the flavor coming out the other end simply wasn't there for me. Yeah they're greasy gut bombs and people like that, but coming from the land of Bunk Sandwiches (greasy gut bombs that they be), this is nowhere near what I'd consider to be gourmet or even all that great. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I'd take this any day over a McDonald's burger or similar. And compared to the vast array of gross casual food served on the strip, this is a step above. But I simply didn't encounter anything close to the 4- and -star raves people are heaping upon this joint. \n\nThe highlights include that the prices are totally reasonable for this part of town, and the tortilla soup is actually pretty good. But my caesar salad had some slimy brown lettuce mix in the midst of the rest of the sturdy romaine, and both of the greasy sandos I sampled were simply that. Greasy and salty and just okay. \n\nFor where it's at, I give it three stars. Anywhere else? I'd probably choose something with more flavor.", "date": "2014-10-02 00:53:28"}

All were fantastic.\n  Ok, here's my rant (almost pulled one star, but couldn't do it):  I am at a $100/meal, high-end steak house for a nice meal with my family.  We are all dressed appropriately for a night of fine dining.  Why in the heck do nice restaurants in Vegas NOT HAVE A DANG DRESS CODE??!!
